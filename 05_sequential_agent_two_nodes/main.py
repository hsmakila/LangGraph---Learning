### âœ… Learning Objectives
* How to define and connect **multiple nodes** in a graph to create a sequence of operations.
* How to pass and update state progressively through multiple nodes.
* How to build a composite message by combining outputs from different nodes.
* Reinforce managing state mutations in a multi-step workflow.
