### âœ… Learning Objectives
* How to define a custom state with `TypedDict`.
* How to create a simple node that updates state.
* How to build a single node graph with nodes and edges.
* How to compile and run a LangGraph.
* Basics of functional, state-based workflows.
* How to visualize the graph structure.
