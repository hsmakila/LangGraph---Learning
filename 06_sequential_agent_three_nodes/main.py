### âœ… Learning Objectives
* How to extend multi-node sequences to handle complex state updates over several steps.
* How to work with lists in state and convert them into formatted strings.
* How to progressively build and append information to a single state field across nodes.
* How to visualize the full graph with multiple nodes connected sequentially.
